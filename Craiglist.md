Step 1 Import the neccessary tools and packages that i will use and load my data set

 Step 2 handle missing values, drop unnecessary columns, and convert the "posting_date" to a datetime data type

 Step 3 Step After successfully handling missing values and cleaning the data i willl move to the next step where i will aggregate the data based on the "posting_date," "region," and "type" of vehicle, to be able to analyze the temporal patterns, seasonal trends, and demand-supply dynamics

conclusion
The difficulty in identifying the trend and seasonality in the plot can be attributed to the fact that the data was collected over a short time span, which makes it hard to clearly see the inherent seasonal and trend patterns.
